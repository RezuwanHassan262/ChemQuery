# ChemQuery: Learn Molecules Easily

[**ChemQuery**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Rezuwan/ChemQuery) is a free, student-focused chemistry assistant that lets you explore molecular structures by simply entering a chemical name.

Powered by [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and [PubChemPy](https://pypi.org/project/PubChemPy/), this app gives you:
- IUPAC name
- Synonyms
- Molecular formula and weights
- Atom and bond structure
- A downloadable `.txt` summary

Hosted live on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Rezuwan/ChemQuery) using Gradio.
